💖 The Forever Queen App 👑

A personalized, interactive web application built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript, designed to deliver sweet, random love notes and include a fun, cheeky challenge.

✨ Features

This app is a single, self-contained HTML file (easy to deploy and share!) and includes the following features:

Romantic Welcome Shower: The page loads with a 2-second shower of flowers, hearts, and confetti (🌹, 🌸, ✨) for a dramatic, celebratory entrance.

Random Love Note Generator: Clicking the "✨ Reveal Love Note" button pulls a random, heartfelt message from a local list and displays it with a smooth transition.

The "Chase" Mechanic (Mobile-Friendly!):

If the user taps "I don't love", the main button turns red and begins to run away from the cursor/finger.

A message challenges the user to "Catch the running heart, my dear!"

The user must successfully click or tap the moving button to reveal a love note and stop the chase. This works perfectly on phones using touch events!

Responsive Design: Looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.

🚀 How to Run the App

Since the entire project is contained within a single HTML file, getting started is extremely easy:

Save the file: Save the content of index.html to a file named index.html on your computer.

Open in Browser: Double-click the index.html file. It will immediately open in your default web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.) and run instantly.

✍️ How to Personalize (HIGHLY Recommended)

The heart of this project is personalization. To truly impress your girlfriend, you should edit the list of generic messages to include things only you two would understand.

In the index.html file, look for the JavaScript section and modify the messages array:

// --- Local Messages Array ---
const messages = [
    // R E P L A C E   T H E S E   M E S S A G E S
    "Your smile is my favorite part of the day, every day.",
    "I love the way your mind works and how you see the world.",
    "You bring a quiet joy to my life that nothing else can match.",
    "I love the sound of your laugh—it's the best melody.",
    // A D D   Y O U R   O W N   I N S I D E   J O K E S !
    // e.g., "I love you more than you love that oversized coffee mug."
    // e.g., "Our trip to Paris was the best 3 days of my life."
];


Customization Steps:

Open index.html in a plain text editor (like VS Code, Notepad, or TextEdit).

Find the const messages = [ block (around line 180).

Change or add messages that reference inside jokes, shared memories, or specific qualities you adore about her.

Save the file and refresh your browser to see the changes!
